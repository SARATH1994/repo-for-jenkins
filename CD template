Need to give the build  no as a input the master job which is taking care of triggering other related CD job 
which we want to release to higher environments

If current environment is not dev it will done the promotion by reading properties files

eg : In artifactory ,

dev -> qa , update the promotion_history file.csv
qa -> model
model -> perf

In QA, it wii download the artifact from that path will do deployment

#### DEV ########

2.DEV-INT
####### Non-prod ##########
3.QA
4.MODEL
5.PERF
###### PROD ########
