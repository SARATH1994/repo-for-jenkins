Reading VM and Containerization

Computer Hardware includes the physical, tangible parts or components of a computer, such as the cabinet, central processing unit, monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard. By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware

The KERNEL is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. On most systems, it is one of the first programs loaded on start-up

The term 'software' refers to the set of electronic program instructions or data a computer processor reads in order to perform a task or operation. There are two main types of software: systems software and application software.

System software is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs. ... The operating system (OS) is the best-known example of system software. The OS manages all the other programs in a computer.

With the help of Hyper-visor, it will allow us to run differnt OS's with feling like entirely New computers as similar to existing computer by using Host Os or with out host Os

Hyper visor is a software or a program which helps in running differnt machines what we call as a Virtual Machines on host machine 

1.With Host Os 
2.With out Host Os means on a bare metal

It’s what sits between the Hardware and the Virtual machine and is necessary to virtualize the server.

Within each virtual machine runs a unique guest operating system. 

VMs with different operating systems can run on the same physical server—a UNIX VM can sit alongside a Linux VM, and so on. 

Each VM has its own binaries, libraries, and applications that it services, and the VM may be many gigabytes in size.
